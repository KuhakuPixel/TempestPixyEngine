# TempestPixyEngine
- A simple chess engine (under 3000 lines ) written in c++  which is easy and simple to read / understand
- Uses Minimax and alphabeta pruning to search and evaluate the current position
# Compiling
Build the project using python (at least version 3.0)
```sh
 python3 build.py
```
TODO:
- use cmake to build the project
- use google benchmark to test performance
- Improve performance
- planning to make this into a simple machine learning framework for board and zero sum games
