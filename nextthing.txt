I have read about how the search will actually be implemented in a tree like datastructure
The problem is now that we need to determine what type of object will be in the tree
(How much overhead it should have like should it have a pointer to the first position)
(should it have the number of depth? so it is easily known when to stop calculating for moves))


After that there will be an algorithm that can min max a tree like structure





Lets Add a feature to check the board who is currently winning ?? so that 
It can tell which side is winning or the state of the game,whiteWins blackWins or draw?

Add function GetGameState parameter:board and sideToMove
which returns an enum

-Add function to test if checkmate?

-Add function eval function
so that it can be converted to value and for the alphabeta algorithm to recognize
