I have read about how the search will actually be implemented in a tree like datastructure
The problem is now that we need to determine what type of object will be in the tree
(How much overhead it should have like should it have a pointer to the first position)
(should it have the number of depth? so it is easily known when to stop calculating for moves))


After that there will be an algorithm that can min max a tree like structure
