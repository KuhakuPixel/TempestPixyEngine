-Create a function to check if a square is attack,useful to check  example :
	-Check if a move is illegal by king is capturable
	-Check if checkmate? and ect
	-Should be put in a separate class probably since it will be used by the search and eval algoritm

-the function to check if a square is under attack can fail if it is a pawn because 
 the pawn moves differently when attacking
